**שאלה:** How often do you clean the Pro-Aero filters when using with a J5 printer?

**תשובה:** For the J5 printer, the recommended filter replacement schedule is as follows:



1. Pre-filter: Replace whichever comes first:

   - Every 200 printing hours

   - Every 3 months



2. Combined filter: Replace whichever comes first:

   - Every 350 printing hours

   - Every 6 months

   - When the filter replacement indicator flashes red



Additionally, ensure to have spare filters on site to avoid prolonged system unavailability. If the fan speed is higher than recommended, the filters may become clogged earlier than expected.
